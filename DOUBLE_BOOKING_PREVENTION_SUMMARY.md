- ✅ **Conflict detection and avoidance**: Proactive conflict prevention with alternative suggestions

### 4. Enhanced Notification & User Experience
- ✅ **Real-time conflict notifications**: Interactive alerts with detailed conflict information and resolution options
- ✅ **Optimistic locking mechanisms**: User session isolation with lock acquisition/release automation
- ✅ **Database-level conflict prevention**: Comprehensive transaction management with rollback capabilities

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Layer
- **New PostgreSQL Functions**:
  - `check_booking_conflicts_exclusive()` - Exclusive conflict checking with FOR UPDATE locks
  - `acquire_booking_lock()` - Session-based lock management
  - `get_conflict_resolution_data()` - Comprehensive conflict analysis with alternatives
  - `get_booking_lock_status()` - Real-time lock status monitoring
  - `get_active_sessions_for_period()` - Multi-user session tracking

- **New Tables**:
  - `booking_locks` - Optimistic locking with session tracking and expiration management

### Application Layer
- **Enhanced Components**:
  - `BookingWizard` - Integrated real-time conflict detection with lock acquisition
  - `ConflictNotification` - Interactive conflict resolution interface
  - `RealtimeBookingStatus` - Live session and lock status monitoring
  - `BookingConfirmation` - Final validation with conflict prevention

- **Service Layer**:
  - `DoubleBookingPrevention` class - Comprehensive conflict management
  - `useDoubleBookingPrevention` hook - React integration with real-time updates
  - Enhanced API routes for conflict status monitoring

### Real-time Features
- **Automatic Conflict Detection**: 
  - 30-second background checks during booking process

  - Visual alerts with detailed conflict information
  - Proactive resolution suggestions

- **Session Management**:
  - 10-minute booking locks with expiration warnings
  - Multi-user session awareness and conflict avoidance
  - Automatic cleanup of expired locks

### Performance & Scalability
- **Database Optimization**:
  - Indexed tables for fast conflict detection
  - Efficient queries with minimal lock time
  - Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

- **Client Optimization**:
  - Debounced real-time checks to prevent API flooding
